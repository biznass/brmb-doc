## What is the Avenza Map Store?
 
The Avenza Map Store contains spatially referenced maps from around the world including USGS and Canadian Topographic maps. The Avenza Map Store can be accessed directly through the app where in-app purchases can be made. Maps can be downloaded for free as well. Vendors can register and sell their maps on the Avenza Map Store. See more info about the Avenza Map Store.
 
 ## Can i view maps offline?
  
 Yes! Maps are stored on the device and can be used offline. This is a great feature for travelers who wish to load up maps before they travel outside of their home network coverage area - no roaming data charges! It works great with using a device that has GPS built-in (GPS can remain on even when cellular data is disabled).
